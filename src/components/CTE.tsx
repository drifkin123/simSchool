                        For middle and high school students exploring teaching as a CTE pathway, it is often difficult or prohibitive to provide live in-classroom observation and field experience, and frequently hands-on teaching is rare.

                        simSchool simulations provide that live engagement, giving CTE students a change to teach their own simulated students, reflect, and even develop confidence in collaborating with peers in discussing simStudent needs and teaching strategies, laying a groundwork for future participation in peer learning communities.
