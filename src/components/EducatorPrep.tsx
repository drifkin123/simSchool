                        For educator preparation programs, often candidates engage in coursework months or years before they will spend time in live classrooms, or even if they are placed in live environments, their access to tangible student interaction and instructional moments is limited. Concepts become conceptual rather than tangible.

                        simSchool simulations provide that tangible engagement, giving candidates a change to teach their own simulated students, reflect, and develop skill in collaborating with peers in discussing simStudent needs and teaching strategies, and implementing the strategies and concepts discussed throughout their coursework.

                        <p>"When high school students in Teacher Cadet clubs in Pennsylvania utilized simSchool, we found that their knowledge and understanding of the practice of teaching exceeded what we often see in our incoming undergraduates. Being actively engaged in problem-solving and decision-making forced a 'need to know' urgency that drove engagement and skills development.The use of teaching simulations is a valuable tool in the preparation of future teachers in providing not only interactive observations, but providing targeted feedback to iteratively improve pedagogical and management teaching practices. As a teacher educator, I have the ability to monitor progress of my PSTs and have reflective discussions about the simulations that allowed the PSTs to think more deeply about pedagogy, classroom management, and focusing on individual learning needs."</p>
